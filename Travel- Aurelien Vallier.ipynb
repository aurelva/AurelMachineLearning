    "\n",
    "You are a Data Scientist for a tourism company named \"Visit with us\". \n",
    "The Policy Maker of the company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base.\n",
    "A viable business model is a central concept that helps you to understand the existing ways of doing the business \n",
    "and how to change the ways for the benefit of the tourism sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are 5 types of packages the company is offering - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King. \n",
    "Looking at the data of the last year, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages.\n",

    "- To achieve our goal of identifying potential customers for the newly introduced package, we recommend the usage of various models. 3 models are relevant (stacking, gradientboost, xgboost) although we achieve the greatest probability of detecting customers who are going to take the package with Stacking them together using certain parameters. \n",
    "- Doing show will help predicting with up to 82% success rate the consumer who are going to take the package. \n",
    "- It will also help saving on marketing cost since we will avoid pursuing and reaching out too broadly to customers who wont take the new package. Depending on the budget restrictions, it might be wise to use the model achieving the greatest level of precision with decent recall rate. In this case the gradientboosting_tuned version.\n",
    "- In general, we note that most of the models concur that the 5 most important features into a client taking a package or not are : having a passport, monthlyincome, product pitched, duration of pitch, number of follow ups.\n",
    "- This indicate that the marketing efforts (duration of pitch, number of follow up) do play a role in getting a new package taken.\n",
    "- We also note that the segmentation of the package (notably how luxurious it is) plays an important role into a specific customer taking this package or not. Thus the segmentation of our new package will have to be carefully chosen to reach out to a maximum number of customer and/or to generate the maximum profit.\n",
    "- Once the segmentation of the package has been chosen, we could re-use our models to fine tune the targeted customers. \n",
